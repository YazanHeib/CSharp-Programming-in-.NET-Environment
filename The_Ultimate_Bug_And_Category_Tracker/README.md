# 🐞 BugMaster 3000 – The Ultimate Bug & Category Tracker

## About This Project

This project teaches how to build a structured system for tracking bugs and organizing them into categories using different storage types (SQL, JSON, Mock).  
You’ll learn to apply design patterns like Factory and Composite, work with data hierarchies, and connect GUI elements in WPF with backend logic.  
It also includes saving data to files in a clean, tree-like format.  
Perfect for learning clean code, OOP design, and real-world application structure.
